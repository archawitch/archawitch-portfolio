This allows you to take notes, list todo-tasks, and stay focused.<br/><br/>I started this project since I couldn't find any online websites, where I could write down my ideas, that fit my needs. After this, I learned React fundamental concepts such as state management, React components, and much more. <br/><br/>You can explore its codebase on <a class='link' href='https://github.com/archawitch/Tasky' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> or check out the demo at <a class='link' href='https://taskyboard.online' target='_blank'>taskyboard.online</a>"
