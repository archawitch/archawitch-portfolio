      "description": "<b>Tasky</b> brings the traditional desk board into your computer. This allows you to take notes, list todo-tasks, and stay focused.<br/><br/>I started this project because I had no ideas where I should put my notes. I also tried to find some online spaces out there, but it turned out that none fit my needs. The main idea of this project is to create a simple website where <b>everyone can take some notes and forget them, and then they can come back and remember</b>. However, having only this concept seemed superficial to me, so I added a few more features like <b>a timer and a to-do list</b>.<br/><br/>During the development stage, I found that the timer part was very tricky to deal with. When I tried to write code that contained only an interval that updated a counter state every second, it wasn't counting when my laptop slept. This occured because the browser also stopped running, and caused the interval to stop. However, I solved this problem by using the timestamp when the user clicks on the start button. This counts the time passed by subtracting current timestamp from the start timestamp, so we don't need to worry about the state and its accuracy. I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but it works ðŸ˜Ž.<br/><br/>For the demo, you can check it out at <a class='link' href='https://taskyboard.online' target='_blank'>taskyboard.online</a>, or if you want to see the code, you can find it on <a class='link' href='https://github.com/archawitch/Tasky' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.<br/><br/>Created with <i>React</i>."
